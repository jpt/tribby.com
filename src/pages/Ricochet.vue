  p #[a(href="https://ricochet.im/") Ricochet] is the most private way to communicate over the Internet (no metadata!) out of the box; you don't have to know anything about the underlying tech (Tor routing!) for it to work. Ricochet doesn't have a power structure but I have been working as its de fact head of product.</p>

  <p>Recently I've been working on the UI and UX, general product goals and vision, branding, and more.</p>
