  p #[a(href="https://ricochet.im/") Ricochet] is the most private way to communicate over the Internet (no metadata!) out of the box; you don't have to know anything about the underlying tech (Tor routing!) for it to work. Remember William Binney and the "turn-key totalitarian state" he warned about? Trump is about to inherit that apparatus. I have been working on a new UI and user experience to attract more people to the app.
