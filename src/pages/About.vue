    h1 About
    p I like building products. I work the entire process, from typography design to bare metal at the datacenter. I'll explain myself this way: I think Raymond Pettibon has a lot more to say about grids and spacing than Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockmann.

    p I help out at the Electronic Frontier Foundation when I can, and more recently the Ricochet project and on a libre typeface called Barlow. I try to work with people and organizations that can keep my work in the open source/libre world.

    p Feel free to #[router-link(to="/about/contact") contact me].
