    h1 About
    p I like building products. I work the entire process, from typography design to bare metal at the datacenter.

    p I help out at the Electronic Frontier Foundation when I can, and more recently on the Ricochet project and a libre typeface called Barlow. I try to work with people and organizations that can keep my work in the open source/libre world.

    p Feel free to #[router-link(to="/about/contact") contact me].
