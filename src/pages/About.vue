    p I like building products. I work the entire process, from typography design to bare metal at the datacenter.

    p I help out at the Electronic Frontier Foundation when I can, and more recently I've begun to focus on the Ricochet project, and a libre typeface called Barlow.

    p Feel free to #[router-link(to="/about/contact") contact me] about interesting problems looking for solutions.
