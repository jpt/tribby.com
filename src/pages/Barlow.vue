  p #[a(href="https://github.com/jpt/barlow") Barlow] is a libre, open source typeface I am currently developing. It's named after activist, co-founding EFF internet pioneer, and songwrtier John Perry Barlow.
  p If DIN and Interstate and Highway Gothic, and the California license plate are all fonts for the public highways, what is a font for Barlow's information superhighway?
