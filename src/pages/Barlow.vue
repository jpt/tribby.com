  p #[a(href="https://github.com/jpt/barlow") Barlow] is a libre, open source typeface I am currently developing. It's named after activist, co-founding EFF internet pioneer, and songwriter John Perry Barlow.
  p DIN, Interstate, and Highway Gothic are all fonts for public highways. What is a font for Barlow's information superhighway?
