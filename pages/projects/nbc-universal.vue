        <p>NBC Universal commissioned a DIN-like font family consisting of 25 styles called Arthouse.</p>

<p>It was my great fortune that the project was overseen by and largely a collaboration with Bruce Fallini, NBC Design Standards Manager. We went through many, many rounds of visual, technical, and philosophical revisions. The font was kerned and spaced by Igino Marini, whose theory on letter-fitting is worth a read! The font went live on air in Q4 2019, and can be seen on your local NBC and Telemundo affiliate station.</p>
