<!--       <p>At the EFF I worked on a varitety of projects mostly as a design engineer. In terms of usability and design I think the site we spun out for <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">Certbot</a> was one of the most successful tools I worked on while there. The Certbot CLI lent itself to an easy documentation website &mdash; pick your webserver, pick your OS, and you're ready to go.</p> -->

      <p>While there I worked on the redesign and reorganization of the main eff.org site, adding mobile support and generally moving the site toward being an authoritative destination for news, not just a source for pull quotes in other publications.</p>
